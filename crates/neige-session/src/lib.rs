//! Wire protocol + framing helpers shared between the daemon and its clients.
//!
//! A client (neige-server, or the standalone test CLI) opens the daemon's
//! Unix socket, sends `ClientMsg::Attach {cols, rows}` as the first frame,
//! then reads a `DaemonMsg::Hello { replay }` whose `replay` is the recent
//! window of raw PTY bytes (kept in a server-side ring buffer). The client
//! feeds those bytes straight into its own VT emulator (e.g. xterm.js) to
//! repaint the screen. From there it's a duplex stream of `ClientMsg::Stdin`
//! / `ClientMsg::Resize` upstream and `DaemonMsg::Stdout` /
//! `DaemonMsg::ChildExited` downstream.
//!
//! Framing: length-prefix u32 big-endian + bincode-serde-encoded payload.
